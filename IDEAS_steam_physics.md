# Idea: pressure/volume/temperature steam physics

Living scratchpad for redesigning steam from a flow-only model into a
pressure/heat/volume model. Read + edit freely as we go. Nothing here is committed to yet.

Status: **IMPLEMENTED (v3 — unified ideal-gas).** One real pressure (bar) drives everything.

## v3 unified model (current)

One physical pressure, real units:
- `P (bar) = gasConstant · storedSteamMb · temperatureK / volumeBlocks`  (ideal gas, `SteamPhysics`).
- `temperatureK = tempBaseK + waterGatedHeat · tempPerHeatK` (fire heats the steam).
- Production: `steamPerBlock · volume · heatFactor` mB/t boiled into the vessel.
- Engine **draws ∝ P** (`flowPerBar · P`, capped `maxIntakeMb`) → pressure self-regulates to
  equilibrium `P_eq = production/flowPerBar`.
- **RPM = rpmPerBar · P** (cap maxRpm), **SU = suPerBar · P** (cap suMax). Both rise with pressure
  (pure single-cylinder physics — bigger/hotter boiler = faster AND stronger).
- Open pipes vent ∝ P (relief). Past `warnBar` → hiss/particles; past `burstBar` → explosion
  (power scales with tank size). Same P does buildup + burst — no separate quantity.

Defaults: gasConstant 2e-4, tempBaseK 373, tempPerHeatK 100, steamPerBlock 90/27, heatNominal 9,
rpmPerBar 6.4, suPerBar 14745.6, flowPerBar 9, maxIntakeMb 90, ventPerBar 12, warnBar 15, burstBar 25.
Tiers (equilibrium): 3x3x1 ~3.3 bar/21 RPM/49152 SU; 3x3x3 ~10 bar/64 RPM/147456 SU; bigger/cakes
overproduce -> burst unless vented or fed to more engines. Compact uses steady-state P directly.

NOTE: this REVERSED the earlier tiers (big boiler is now fast+strong, not slow+torquey) — the
pure-physics choice. Calibration is first-pass; tune the steamPhysics config in-game.

## (history) v1 flow-tier design below — superseded by v3

---

## LOCKED DESIGN (shipped) — v2 consumption-limited / volume-tiered

Decisions:
- **Replace** the flow-only model outright. No opt-in flag.
- Specs from **boiler volume + heat ratio**. **No** regulator block yet.
- **Continuous** RPM. All numbers **config-backed** (`steamPhysics` group) for repeated tuning.
- Anchor: **a full-heat 3×3×3 boiler (volume 27) exactly maxes one cylinder** = 90 mB/t → 147456 SU,
  16 RPM. Bigger boilers overproduce (→ overpressure); smaller = less SU, higher RPM.

Model (`content/steam/SteamPhysics.java`), inputs read off Create's `BoilerData`:
- `V` = `boiler.getTotalTankSize()` (tank block count).
- `sizeCap` = `getMaxHeatLevelForBoilerSize(V)`, `waterGatedHeat = min(activeHeat, getMaxHeatLevelForWaterSupply())`.
- `heatRatio = clamp(waterGatedHeat / sizeCap, 0, heatRatioMax)` (1.0 = fully fired for its size; >1 = super-heated/cakes).
- `production = round(steamPerBlock · V · heatRatio)` mB/t  (`steamPerBlock = 90/27` → 3×3×3 full = 90).
- `pressure p = heatRatio · maxVolumeReference / V`  (`maxVolumeReference=27`; p=1.0 at full-heat 3×3×3).
- `RPM = clamp(rpmAtMaxVolume · p, 0, maxRpm)`  (`rpmAtMaxVolume=16`, `maxRpm=64`).
- `SU = min(cylinderMaxSu, consumed · suPerSteamMb)`, `consumed ≤ cylinderMaxIntakeMb`
  (`cylinderMaxIntakeMb=90`, `cylinderMaxSu=147456`). **Consumption-limited** — this is the hard cap.

Full-heat tiers (config defaults):
| boiler | V | mB/t | RPM | SU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1×1×1 | 1 | 3 | 64 | ~5.5k |
| 2×2×2 | 8 | 27 | 54 | ~44k |
| 3×3×1 | 9 | 30 | 48 | 49152 |
| 3×3×2 | 18 | 60 | 24 | 98304 |
| 3×3×3 | 27 | 90 | 16 | 147456 |
| >3×3×3 | >27 | >90 | <16 | 147456 (surplus → overpressure) |

Propagation:
- **Direct/compact** engine reads its boiler locally (`calculateDirectSteamOutput`): same V + heatRatio.
  Compact is fixed 3×3×1 → mid tier (49152 SU / 48 RPM); a maxed cylinder needs a piped 3×3×3.
- **Piped**: `BoilerOutletBlockEntity` computes its boiler's `p` and reports it to reachable assembled
  inlets during the push BFS (`reportSupplyPressure`, max-wins, 10-tick decay). Piston RPM from
  delivered pressure; SU from steam actually consumed (capped). The boiler's finite production splits
  among the engines drawing from it, so no duplication.

Goggles: outlet shows pressure + volume + production; piston/cylinder ring show pressure + RPM + SU.

## DONE: boiler overpressure (built 2026-06-05). Vent valve still future.

Implemented in `BoilerOutletBlockEntity`:
- `overpressureMb += max(0, productionRate − pushedRate)` per tick (vented/open-pipe/engine steam =
  pushed → relieves); bleeds by `reliefMbPerTick` when not over-producing.
- `> warnPressureMb` → "Overpressure!" status + hiss + steam particles at boiler center.
- `> burstPressureMb` → explosion at boiler center, power `min(maxPower, basePower + perVolume·tankSize)`,
  block-breaking (configurable). Resets after.
- Config group `steamOverpressure` (all tunable); NBT-persisted; goggle shows buildup %.
- Lit-gate heat means a boiler over-produces vs a smaller-than-3×3×3 engine load → builds → bursts
  unless an open pipe / enough engines relieve it.

Steam vent valve (FUTURE block): attaches to boiler/pipe, bleeds up to ventRateMb/t of surplus
(hot scald cloud), manual/redstone — the clean alternative to an open pipe.

## (original design notes below)

## NEXT: overpressure + steam vent valve (designed, not yet built)

The point of the consumption cap: if a boiler **produces more steam than is consumed**, the surplus has
nowhere to go and should build pressure until the **boiler explodes**, unless bled by a future **steam
vent valve** block.

Proposed design (to confirm with user before building — it's destructive):
- Track surplus on the boiler outlet (or boiler): each tick `surplus += producedMb − movedMb` (steam
  produced but not pushed to a consumer / open end). Clamp at 0 floor.
- When `surplus` (or an accumulated "pressure" integral) exceeds `overpressureThreshold` for longer
  than `overpressureGraceTicks`, trigger an explosion at the boiler (configurable power, like TNT-ish),
  scaling with boiler size. Warning phase first: shaking gauge / hiss / particles as it nears the limit.
- **Steam vent valve** (future block): attaches to the boiler or pipe network; bleeds up to `ventRateMb`
  per tick of surplus (venting a hot steam cloud = reuses the scald handler), keeping pressure below
  the threshold. Manual or redstone-gated.
- All knobs config-backed: enable flag, threshold, grace ticks, explosion power, vent rate.

Locked decisions (2026-06-05):
- **Explosion = break blocks + hurt entities** (TNT-like blast at the boiler, power scales with size, config-tunable).
- **Open/venting pipe ends relieve pressure** — steam pushed out an open end counts as consumed (deliberate
  open pipe = crude relief, with the existing scald cloud). Vent valve = the clean version.
- **Build AFTER the tier rebalance is tested in-game** (do not build until user confirms tiers feel right).

Still open:
- [ ] Pressure source of truth: boiler outlet vs the Create Fluid Tank BE (mixin) — outlets are ours, simpler. Lean outlet.
- [ ] Warning UX: gauge + sound + particles thresholds before the blast.
- [ ] Vent valve block specifics (placement, rate, redstone gating) — separate block project.

## Current model (what we have today)

Flow-only, single scalar. (`BoilerOutletBlockEntity`, `PistonHeadBlockEntity`, `FullSteamConfig`,
`README.md`.)

- Production: `productionRate = heatUnits * steamPerHeatUnit` mB/t, where
  `heatUnits = min(activeBurnerUnits, waterHeatLevel) * boilerHeight`. Pure rate.
- Consumption → output: `heatUnits = ceil(consumedMb / steamPerHeatUnit)`, `SU = consumedMb *
  suPerSteamMb` (capped), `RPM = tier(consumedMb)`. Tiers 16/32/48/64.
- **No pressure, no volume, no temperature.** Boiler size only scales total mB/t. Big vs small
  boiler differ only in throughput, never in the RPM-vs-SU character.

## What we want (user intent)

Steam shouldn't be one number. Bring **heat + pressure (especially) + volume** into play so boiler
*shape/size* gives different "specs", like a torque-vs-speed tradeoff:
- **Big boiler** → large steam volume → more **SU** but lower **RPM** (slow, torquey).
- **Small high-pressure boiler** → high **RPM** but less SU (fast, weak).
- Power (SU × RPM) roughly conserved for a given energy input; pressure picks the operating point.

## How Clockwork (VS) does it — inspiration, NOT to copy

Clockwork = Create × Valkyrien Skies airships. Source: `github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Clockwork`,
package `org.valkyrienskies.clockwork.content.logistics.gas`. The actual gas thermodynamics live in
a **separate library, Kelvin** (`org.valkyrienskies.kelvin`) — Clockwork just wires nodes into it.

Model (ideal-gas, graph-based):
- The world has a **gas network** of nodes (ducts, tanks, ports) — `duct/DuctPipeNode.kt` uses
  Kelvin `PipeDuctNode`/`ILeakNode`. Each node has a **volume**; gas in it has **mass (amount)** and
  **temperature** → Kelvin computes **pressure** (PV = nRT style). Gas flows down pressure gradients
  through ducts/valves; leaks vent (their `pockets/nozzle/LeakParticle`).
- Gas **reactions** are datapack-driven (`data/vs_clockwork/kelvin_reactions/*.json`,
  `recipes/gas_crafting/*.json`) — combustion etc. add heat/mass (phlogiston, stellane…).
- **SteamGenerator** (`generation/steam_generator/SteamGeneratorBlockEntity.kt`) sits on a Create
  Fluid Tank boiler and each tick injects steam gas into the network:
  - `efficiency = clamp(tank.boiler.getEngineEfficiency(totalTankSize), 0, 1)` (reuses Create boiler
    heat/water),
  - `mass = maxMass(0.1) * efficiency`,
  - `temperature = 80 * (max(0.25, activeHeat) * 100)^0.34` — **hotter boiler ⇒ hotter steam**,
  - `network.addGasAtTemperature(node, steam, mass, temperature)`; pressure cap
    `maxPressurePerLevel = 17_000_000 / 8`.
- **GasEngine** (`engine/GasEngineBlockEntity.kt` + `mixin/.../MixinSteamEngineBlockEntity`) reads
  the **temperature at its node** → `efficiency = (temp - 80) / 290 / 6` → drives Create's steam
  engine shaft speed/stress. Power scales with **delivered gas temperature/pressure**, not raw mB.
- Heaters/coal burner add heat; heatsink stores it; compressor adds pressure; exhaust vents.

Why we won't clone it: Kelvin is a heavy per-tick gas-network graph tied to VS, with its own duct
blocks and reaction datapacks. We want the *feel* (pressure/volume specs), not a second logistics
network. Our steam already rides **Create's own fluid pipes**, which we should keep.

---

## Proposed model for us (lightweight, no gas-network library)

Keep steam on Create pipes. Add a few derived scalars instead of a node graph.

1. **Steam carries pressure + temperature, not just mB.** Represent per **boiler-outlet / pipe
   path**, not per block, to stay cheap:
   - `temperature ∝ activeHeat` (burner heat / blaze-cake), like Clockwork's `80*(heat*100)^0.34`.
   - `pressure = f(producedMass, networkVolume, temperature)` — ideal-gas-ish: more mass or hotter
     ⇒ higher pressure; more volume ⇒ lower. `networkVolume` ≈ reachable pipe/tank block count (or a
     cheaper proxy: boiler footprint/height + a configured nominal).
2. **Engine output is a torque–speed curve, not a tier table:**
   - `SU (torque) ∝ delivered steam mass/flow` (how much steam you can move),
   - `RPM (speed) ∝ delivered pressure` (clamped to 64),
   - bounded so `SU × RPM ≲ energyInput` ⇒ raising one lowers the other.
3. **Boiler specs emerge from geometry:**
   - wide/tall boiler = big volume = low pressure, high mass ⇒ high SU / low RPM,
   - small/throttled boiler (or a new "pressure regulator"/throttle block) = high pressure ⇒ high
     RPM / low SU.
4. Reuse what exists: Create boiler `activeHeat`/water via `BoilerData` (already read), valve-aware
   pressure traversal (already implemented), the steam buffer, goggle overlays (add pressure/temp
   lines), and the leak handler (could vent more / hotter at high pressure → ties into the new scald
   damage).

### Possible new/changed pieces
- A `SteamState`/`SteamParcel` value (mB + pressure + temperature) flowing outlet → inlet.
- Outlet computes pressure from heat + estimated network volume; inlet reports delivered pressure to
  the piston head.
- Piston head output = `torqueFromFlow × speedFromPressure` curve instead of `tier(mB)`.
- Optional **throttle/regulator** block to trade SU↔RPM manually (the "small high-pressure" lever).
- Config: enable-new-model flag, pressure curve constants, volume proxy, power cap.

---

## Feasibility & effort

- **Simplified pressure model: feasible / medium effort.** It's mostly math in
  `BoilerOutletBlockEntity` (produce pressure) and `PistonHeadBlockEntity` (consume → torque-speed
  curve) + a richer steam value object + goggle/config. No new logistics network.
- **Full Kelvin-style per-node gas sim: not recommended.** High complexity + per-tick graph cost +
  would fork us off Create pipes. Only worth it if we ever want true multi-gas reactions.

### Risks / unknowns
- Create pipe networks don't cleanly expose "volume" — need a proxy (reachable-block count is
  O(network) per change; cache it like the existing pressure traversal). 
- Rebalancing the whole SU/RPM table; keep parity so a stock boiler ≈ today's output at default.
- Backwards compat: gate behind a config/model flag; old worlds keep working.
- Direct-compact mode (no pipes) needs its own pressure proxy (boiler size directly).
- Multiplayer/airship (Sable) — pressure state must be NBT-safe like the rest.

## Open decisions (fill as we discuss)
- [ ] Pressure scope: per outlet, per pipe path, or per connected network?
- [ ] `networkVolume` source: reachable-block count vs boiler-geometry proxy vs configured nominal?
- [ ] Exact torque–speed curve + whether `SU × RPM` is hard-capped (energy conservation) or soft.
- [ ] New throttle/regulator block, or geometry-only specs?
- [ ] Replace the flow-only model outright, or add as an opt-in "realistic steam" config mode?
- [ ] Keep RPM tiers (snap to 16/32/48/64) or go continuous?
